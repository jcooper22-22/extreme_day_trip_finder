## 📜 About

With the growth of budget airlines and increasingly lower fares, short trips abroad within Europe and beyond have become more accessible than ever. In some cases, ticket prices are so low that even international day trips are affordable — especially with carriers like Ryanair.

This web app lets users enter their departure airport, budget, and preferred date range for potential day trips. It then displays matching return flights, including departure and arrival times, as well as total costs.

Currently, the app uses only the Ryanair API, so results are limited to Ryanair-operated routes. This means searches can only be made from airports served by Ryanair.
